# MRG-dsDNA

Tutorial for running dsDNA simulations with the MRG-CG model, which was introduced originally in the following reference

    Savelyev, Alexey, and Garegin A. Papoian. "Chemically accurate coarse graining of double-stranded DNA." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107.47 (2010): 20340-20345.

We recently reparameterized the DNA model for implicit ion simulations as detailed in this paper

    Latham, Andrew P., and Bin Zhang. "On the stability and layered organization of protein-DNA condensates." Biophysical Journal 121.9 (2022): 1727-1737.

The jupyter notebook file *dsDNA.ipynb* includes the detailed instructions for running dsDNA simulation with the MRG-CG model.
