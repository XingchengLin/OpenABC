# Mpipi-protein-RNA-condensate

The tutorial of running protein and RNA simulations with Mpipi model. The Mpipi model is introduced in the following reference: 

    Joseph, Jerelle A., et al. "Physics-driven coarse-grained model for biomolecular phase separation with near-quantitative accuracy." Nature Computational Science 1.11 (2021): 732-743. 

The jupyter notebook *polyR_polyK_polyU_condensate.ipynb* provides details about how to using Mpipi model to run MD simulations.
