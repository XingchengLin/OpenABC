# HP1alpha-dimer

Tutorials about setting up HP1alpha dimer simulations with MOFF and analyzing slab simulation trajectories. 

The jupyter notebook file single_hp1alpha_dimer.ipynb includes setting up and running simulations of a single HP1alpha dimer. It also includes how to set up rigid body simulations. 

The jupyter notebook file hp1alpha_dimer_slab.ipynb includes setting up and running slab simulations for hp1alpha dimer, as well as how to convert CA model to all-atom model. 

The jupyter notebook file analyze_hp1alpha_dimer_slab.ipynb includes analyzing slab simulation trajectories.
