    "In this tutorial, we will show how to use SMOG and 3SPN2 models to study nucleosomes. Nucleosome is a protein-DNA complex. It is composed of a protein octamer called histone, and 147 bp DNA wrapped around the histone. It is the basic unit of genome organization, and it is appropriate to use these near-atomistic CG models to study nucleosomes. \n",

    "Let's begin with loading the structures of a single nucleosome. The protein and DNA structures are both from PDB 1KX5. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when we simulate nucleosomes, we keep using rigid body settings. By default, we rigidize the histone core and the middle 73 bp wrapped around histone as a rigid body. Such rigid body settings help stabilize the stable histone core with inner layer DNA and facilitate a large timestep. Meanwhile, we remove all the native pairs and dihedrals that involve any histone tail atoms, since histone tails are disordered. By considering these two effects, (1) we do not need any native pairs or dihedrals (because any histone atom is in either histone core or histone tail); (2) we want to set rigid body for histone core and middle 73 bps. Notably, even if there is no dihedral potential for histones, nonbonded interactions between 1-4 atom pairs in histone tails are still excluded (as in LAMMPS simulations we keep doing this, though this should not affect the results too much). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 3SPN2 model can capture DNA sequence, we need to load the DNA with sequence information. In the case of nucleosome, the CG DNA configuration is converted from atomistic DNA in 1KX5, but the sequence is reset with the one saved in dna_seq.txt. So we can easily manipulate the sequence of the CG DNA.  "
