    "One useful setting is to apply rigid bodies. We use HP1alpha dimer as an example to show how to manipulate rigid body with our tool. The rigid body code is written by Peter Eastman, and we provide useful methods to help remove bonded interactions within the rigid body and make the simulation more efficient. The rigid body is realized by representing each rigid body with few real sites and certain restraints, while viewing the rest atoms as virtual sites.\n",

All the bonded interactions (bonds, angles, and dihedrals) within each rigid body will be removed to save computational resources. Additionally we do not need to add native pairs as they are all within the rigid bodies. "
