- The jupyter notebook file *hp1alpha_dimer.ipynb* provides detailed instructions on setting up and running simulations of a HP1alpha dimer.
    1. It explains how to extract native contacts from the initial configuration with the shadow algorithm to preserve tertiary structures; 
    2. It also illustrates how to avoid biases in disordered regions to keep their conformational flexibility. 
    3. Example scripts are also provided to rigidify folded domains for enhanced sampling and larger simulation time steps. 

- The jupyter notebook file *hp1alpha_condensate.ipynb* provides detailed instructions on
    1. setting up and running slab simulations for hp1alpha dimer, which consists of the following steps
        - NPT compression to create a densely packaged system. 
        - Place the condensed system into a rectangle box with dense-dilute interface along the z-axis. 
    2. converting coarse-grained configurations to atomistic structures. 

- The jupyter notebook file *condensate_analysis.ipynb* includes python scripts for analyzing slab simulations and computing density profiles. Such analyses are essential for computing phase diagrams. 

For instructional purposes, some intermediate results are prepared in advance so that the users do not need to wait. The full workflow as python scripts, starting from HP1alpha dimer PDB structure, to achieving a density profile of the slab simulation, is shown in <https://github.com/ZhangGroup-MITChemistry/OpenABC/tree/main/examples/HP1alpha-dimer-slab>.
