- The jupyter notebook file *DDX4.ipynb* provides detailed instructions on setting up and running simulations of an intrinsically disordered protein, DDX4. 
    1. The notebook also provides an example on building an initial protein configuration as a straight chain given the amino acid sequence. 

- The jupyter notebook file *DDX4_condensate.ipynb* provides detailed instructions on setting up and running simulations of DDX4 condensates.
