# check-shadow

Check shadow algorithm. 

In each directory, first run `python get_native_pairs.py` to get native pairs with our shadow algorithm code, our legacy shadow algorithm code, and extract native pairs from SMOG output files. Then run `python compare_native_pairs.py` to compare the native pairs given by 3 methods.
