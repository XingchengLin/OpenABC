Check the shadow algorithm with hp1alpha dimer (hp1a.pdb file).

hp1a_dimer.29065.pdb.sb contains output files from SMOG online server. 

Run `python get_native_pairs.py` to get native pairs with our shadow algorithm code, our legacy shadow algorithm code, and extract native pairs from SMOG output files.

Then run `python compare_native_pairs.py` to compare the native pairs given by 3 methods.
