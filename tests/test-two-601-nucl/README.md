# test-two-601-nucl

Test two nucleosomes with 601 sequence. The force field is SMOG+3SPN2. This is also an example about how to use SMOG+3SPN2 to run nucleosome related simulations. 

The LAMMPS results are provided in lammps-rerun.

For OpenMM, there are two sets of parameters: the new and the old geometry parameters. The old ones match LAMMPS results better. openmm-rerun and openmm-rerun-old-geometry include openmm results with the new and old geometry parameters, respectively.
